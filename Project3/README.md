## Project 3: Serverless Computing and Monitoring Dashboard

### Task 1: Serveless Function and Runtime

Students will create and use a serveless function to process the periodic resource use measurements.

### Task 2A: Monitoring Dashboard

In this task, you will build a Kubernetes Pod (including the container image) to display the monitoring information computed by your serverless function.

### What to Submit

1. For Task 1, submit your module's source code (containing the handler function), and two YAML files
   containing your ConfigMaps.
2. For Task 2A, submit all files needed to build your container image and a short PDF containing screenshots of your dashboard and a discussion of the metrics monitored.
